          <p class="lead">Draft</p>
          <p>
            The draft will take place from Tuesday 15th November 2022 to Saturday 19th November 2022 inclusive.
            On each round every manager will choose a single player to join their team.
            Each manager should do their scouting in advance, so 1 or 2 rounds can be completed each day.
            The order will be randomly generated and will alternate on each round.
            For example, if there are 3 teams denoted A, B, C, the order will be: A-B-C-C-B-A ...
            The draft is completed as soon as all teams have 11 players.
            At the end of the draft all teams must comply with the selection restrictions.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Transfers</p>
            A manager can exchange one of their players for an unselected player on a first-come-first-served basis.
            There are no restrictions on the number of transfers allowed.
            Teams must comply with the selection restrictions at all times.
            Transfers can be submitted at any time after the draft is completed, and are immediately binding.
            However, ownership for the purpose of assigning points will only be transferred at the following times:
